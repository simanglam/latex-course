\subsection{圖片}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}：graphicx}
\begin{itemize}
\item 需使用\bftt{graphicx} package提供的\cmdbs{includegraphics}命令
\item 支援的圖片格式有 JPEG, PNG 和 PDF (通常)
\end{itemize}
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\includegraphics[
  width=0.5\textwidth]{gerbil}

\includegraphics[
  width=0.3\textwidth,
  angle=270]{gerbil}
\end{exampletwouptiny}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{小插曲：可選參數}
\begin{itemize}
\item 我們使用中括號來指定可選參數\keystrokebftt{[} \keystrokebftt{]}而不是使用花括號\keystrokebftt{\{} \keystrokebftt{\}}.
\item \cmdbs{includegraphics}接受一些調整圖片的可選參數，舉個例子：\bftt{width=0.3\cmdbs{textwidth}}將圖片寬度設為周遭文字(\cmdbs{textwidth}).的30\%
\item \cmdbs{documentclass}同樣接受可選參數
\mint{latex}|\documentclass[12pt,twocolumn]{article}|
\vskip 3ex
加大文字大小(12pt)和開啟了雙欄模式
\item 哪裡可以找到更多資訊？投影片的做後有連結！

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection[fragile]{浮動體}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item 讓\LaTeX{}決定圖片的具體位置(圖片可以``浮動'').
\item 你可以給圖片加上一段能被\cmdbs{ref}引用的說明文字

\subsection{表格}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item 在\LaTeX{}中使用表格需經過一番適應
\item 使用\bftt{tabularx} package 提供的\bftt{tabular}環境
\item 指定表格靠齊位置的參數 --- \textbf{l}eft, \textbf{r}ight, \textbf{r}ight
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
Item   & Qty & Unit \$ \\
Widget & 1   & 199.99  \\
Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item 這同時也可以指定表格中的垂直線，使用\cmdbs{hline}命令指定水平線
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|} \hline
Item   & Qty & Unit \$ \\\hline
Widget & 1   & 199.99  \\
Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item 使用與號\keystrokebftt{\&}來接每一格分開，使用雙重反斜槓\keystrokebftt{\bs}\keystrokebftt{\bs}來換行(就像 part 1 中提過的\bftt{align*}環境)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{bib\TeX}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item 將你的引用資料遵循`bibtex'的格式寫在\bftt{.bib}檔中
\inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single]{latex}{bib-example.bib}
\item 大部分的引用資料管理器可輸出符合`bibtex'格式的檔案
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 2}
\begin{itemize}
\item 在\bftt{.bib}檔中的每一個條目都會有一個\emph{key}來讓你在文件中引用，舉個例子\bftt{Jacobson1999Towards}是這篇這篇文章的key：
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,frame=single]{latex}
@Article{Jacobson1999Towards,
  author = {Van Jacobson},
  ...
}
\end{minted}
\item 將key設為作者名加出版年份與標題是個好主意
\item \LaTeX{}可以自動格式化你的行內引文，然後甚至創造出一份引用資料的列表，\LaTeX{}知道最標準的格式，你也可以自行設計
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 3}
\begin{itemize}
\item 使用\bftt{natbib} package\footnote{這裡有一個較新的 package \bftt{biblatex} 提供了更多了功能，但大部分的期刊與模板依舊使\bftt{natbib}.} 提供的\cmdbs{citet} 與 \cmdbs{citep}命令
\item 在文章的最後引用\cmdbs{bibliography}，利用\cmdbs{bibliographystyle}來指定格式
\end{itemize}
\begin{minipage}{0.55\linewidth}
\inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single,resetmargins]{latex}%
  {bib-example.tex}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.35\linewidth}

\subsection{小試身手}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{小試身手：將兩者結合在一起}

將圖片與參考書目加入之前用來練習的文章

\begin{enumerate}
\item 卸載這些範例檔案

\subsection{一些酷酷的東西}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item 使用\cmdbs{tableofcontents}命令來創造內容基於\cmdbs{section}命令的目錄 

\item 將\cmdbs{documentclass}改成
\mint{latex}!\documentclass{scrartcl}!
或
\mint{latex}!\documentclass[12pt]{IEEEtran}!

\item 面對複雜的方程式，你可以自行定義命令
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\newcommand{\rperf}{%
  \rho_{\text{perf}}}
$$
\rperf = {\bf c}'{\bf X} + \varepsilon
$$

\subsection{下載 \LaTeX{}}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item 為了在自己的電腦上執行\LaTeX{}，你會想要利用\LaTeX{}的
\emph{發行版}，一個\LaTeX{}應該要包含\bftt{latex}主程式與（通常會有）超過一千的package
\begin{itemize}
\item Windows：\href{http://miktex.org/}{Mik\TeX} or \href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live}
\item Linux：\href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live}
\item Mac：\href{http://tug.org/mactex/}{Mac\TeX}
\end{itemize}
\item 你也會需要支持\LaTeX{}的文字編輯器，在\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors}找到適合自己的吧！
\item 你也需要了解\bftt{latex}和相關的工具是如何工作的 --- 下一張投影片有一些可以用的線上資源

% -- latex understands words, sentences and paragraphs

Words are separated by one or more spaces.  Paragraphs are separated by
one or more blank lines.  The output is not affected by adding extra
spaces or extra blank lines to the input file.

Double quotes are typed like this: ``quoted text''.
Single quotes are typed like this: `single-quoted text'.

Emphasized text is typed like this: \emph{this is emphasized}.
Bold       text is typed like this: \textbf{this is bold}.

-- Adding structure to your document

\section{Hello}

\subsection{World}

\subsection{Foo}

\subsubsection*{Stuff} % star form

\subsubsection*{Results}

-- Labels and cross-references

\label{sec:intro}
\label{sec:method}
\ref{sec:method}

--> maybe introduce the prettyref package here.

-- Mathematics

Inline mathematics: $x + y < 7$.

'Displayed' mathematics:
\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
\end{equation*}

\begin{align}
\end{align}

-- Figures

- Need the graphicx package.

- here we can start introducing options

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{}

- where do you find out about these options? --> link to the Wikibook

-- Floating Figures

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{...}
\caption{\label{}Here is a caption.}
\end{figure}

-- Tables

- not the nicest part of LaTeX

\usepackage{tabularx}

\begin{tabular}{llr}
Item & Quantity & Price (\$) & Amount
Widget & 1 &
\end{tabular}

Bonus points: check out the fp package and the spreadtab package.

-- Document Classes

a .cls file

article

some journal templates come with one

-- Bibliographies



-- For Typesetting Geeks

- dashes: -, --, ---

- ellipsis.

- controlling spaces: ~, \ , \,, \@

- spacing after periods (et al., etc.)

- Nested quotation marks: ``\,`
