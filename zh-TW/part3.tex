%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \tikzname{}是個用來畫畫的\LaTeX{}package
\item 他在\LaTeX{}中定義了強大繪圖語言，簡單的程式碼就可以創造讓人驚豔的圖片
\begin{figure}
\href{http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/rotated-triangle/}{%
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{rotated-triangle}}
\end{figure}
\item 我們會從簡單的事物開始，在\tikzname{}中畫直線：
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (0,0) -- (1,1); % 一條線

\node[above right] at (3,3) {$(3,3)$};
\node[above left] at (0,3) {$(0,3)$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\item 在使用\tikzname{}時畫一個網格是個好主意：
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);

\item 你也可以將節點當作座標點來使用 --- 對圖表很有用
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
