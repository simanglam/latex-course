\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item 最簡單的\LaTeX{}文件：
\inputminted[frame=single]{latex}{basics.tex}
\item 命令以\emph{反斜線}開頭的\keystrokebftt{\bs}.
\item 所有文件都以\cmdbs{documentclass}為開頭
\item \emph{引數}被花括號包圍\keystrokebftt{\{} \keystrokebftt{\}}告訴 \LaTeX{}我們想要的文件類型\bftt{article}.
\item 百分符號\keystrokebftt{\%}開始註解\emph{comment} --- \LaTeX{}會忽略該行剩餘的部分

\subsection{基礎排版}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}：英文}
\small
\begin{itemize}
\item 將你的文字打在 \cmdbegin{document}與\cmdend{document}之間
\item 大多數的時間就和word無異，只需普通的打出文件內容就好%怪怪的，要修
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
Words are separated by one or more
spaces.

Paragraphs are separated by one
or more blank lines.
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item 原始碼中的空白並不代表真實的輸出
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
The   rain       in Spain
falls mainly on the plain.
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}：注意事項}
\small
\begin{itemize}
\item 引號比較刁鑽\\
使用反引號 \keystroke{\`{}}來打出左引號，撇號 \keystroke{\'{}}打出右引號
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
Single quotes: `text'.

Double quotes: ``text''.
\end{exampletwouptiny}

\item 一些常見的符號在\LaTeX\ 有特殊的意義\\[1ex]
\begin{tabular}{cl}
\keystrokebftt{\%} & 百分比記號              \\
\keystrokebftt{\#} & 井字號 \\
\keystrokebftt{\&} & 與                 \\
\keystrokebftt{\$} & 錢幣符號               \\
\end{tabular}
\item 如果你直接打出這些符號那你就只會得到錯誤，為了打出這些這些符號，你必須在每個符號前使用反斜槓來使這些字符\emph{跳脫}他們原本的意義 
\begin{exampletwoup}
\$\%\&\#!
\end{exampletwoup}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{處理錯誤}
\begin{itemize}
\item \LaTeX{} 在編譯時也可能會出錯，如果它出錯了它將會產出錯誤訊息並停止編譯檔案，你必須將修復這個錯誤，否則\LaTeX{} 將不會產生任何的輸出
\item 舉個例子，如果你將\cmdbs{emph}誤拼成\cmdbs{meph}, \LaTeX{}會停止編譯並跳出 ``undefined control sequence''的錯誤，因為``meph''並不是已知的命令
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{面對錯誤的的建議}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 不要慌張！錯誤經常發生的
\item 盡快將他們修復完畢 --- 如果是你剛剛打的東西造成了錯誤，就從該處開始吧！
\item 如過這裡有多個錯誤，先從第一個錯誤開始 --- 造成的原因還有可能在更上面
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{牛刀小試}

\begin{block}{嘗試利用\LaTeX\ 為下面這段文字排版：
\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States}}}
In March 2006, Congress raised that ceiling an additional \$0.79 trillion to
\$8.97 trillion, which is approximately 68\% of GDP. As of October 4, 2008, the
``Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008'' raised the current debt ceiling
to \$11.3 trillion.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{數學排版}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}：錢幣符號}
\begin{itemize}
\item 為什麼錢幣符號\keystrokebftt{\$}特別？因為我們用它來標示數學公式\\[1ex]
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
%並不好：
Let a and b be distinct positive
integers, and let c = a - b + 1.

%好多了：
Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive
integers, and let $c = a - b + 1$.
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item 永遠記得使用一對錢幣符號 --- 一個開始一個結束
\item \LaTeX{} 會自己處理間隙，他會忽略你的空間
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
Let $y=mx+b$ be \ldots

Let $y = m x + b$ be \ldots
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}：標記}
\begin{itemize}
\item 使用\keystrokebftt{\^}來上標文字，底線\keystrokebftt{\_} 來下標文字
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
$y = c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0$
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\vskip 2ex

\item 使用花括號 \keystrokebftt{\{} \keystrokebftt{\}}來標示上標文字的群組
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
$F_n = F_n-1 + F_n-2$     % 糟糕!

$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ % 正常!
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\vskip 2ex

\item 這裡有一些常見的希臘字母與數學表示法
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
$\mu = A e^{Q/RT}$

$\Omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \omega_k$
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}：展示方程式}
\begin{itemize}
\item 如果他是巨大且恐怖的，將他獨立\emph{展示}出來，使用
\cmdbegin{equation} and \cmdend{equation}.\\[2ex]
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
The roots of a quadratic equation
are given by
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}
         {2a}
\end{equation}
where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are \ldots
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\vskip 1em
{\scriptsize 注意：大部分在數學環境中的空間會被\LaTeX{}忽略掉，但\LaTeX{} 無法處理在 equation 中的空白行 --- 不要在數學環境中加入空白行}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{小插曲：環境}
\begin{itemize}
\item \bftt{equation}是個\emph{環境} --- 背景
\item 指令可能會在不同的環境中產出不同的效果
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
We can write
$ \Omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \omega_k $
in text, or we can write
\begin{equation}
  \Omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \omega_k
\end{equation}
to display it.
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\vskip 2ex
\item 即使我們使用相同的命令，我們還是可以發現，$\Sigma$在\bftt{equation}環境中比較大，並且上下標的位置也有所改變
\vskip 1em
{\scriptsize 事實上\bftt{\$...\$}與\cmdbegin{math}\bftt{...}\cmdend{math}是等價的}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{小插曲：環境}
\begin{itemize}
\item \cmdbs{begin}與\cmdbs{end}命令被用來創造許多不同的環境
\vskip 2ex

\item \bftt{itemize}與\bftt{enumerate} 環境創造列表
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{itemize} %以實心圓圈為標示
\item Biscuits
\item Tea
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate} %以數字為標示
\item Biscuits
\item Tea
\end{enumerate}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{小插曲：Package}

\begin{itemize}
\item 至今為止我們都是使用\LaTeX\ 自帶的命令與環境
\item \emph{Packages}提供額外的命令與環境，目前有超過一千種的可用Packages，更讚的是他們都是免費的

\item 在\emph{導言區}使用\cmdbs{usepackage}命令以載入所有我們想要的Packages

\item 例子：美國數學家協會的\bftt{amsmath}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,frame=single]{latex}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath} %導言區
\begin{document}
% 現在你可以在這裡使用amsmath提供的命令與環境
\end{document}
\end{minted}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}：使用\bftt{amsmath}的例子}
\begin{itemize}
\item 使用\bftt{equation*} (``equation-star'')創造未標數字的方程式
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{equation*}
  \Omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \omega_k
\end{equation*}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item \LaTeX{} 會將相鄰的字母視為相乘的變數，有時候會達不到你想要的效果，\bftt{amsmath}定義了許多常用的數學運算子
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{equation*} % 糟糕！
 min_{x,y} (1-x)^2 + 100(y-x^2)^2
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*} % 好多了！
\min_{x,y}{(1-x)^2 + 100(y-x^2)^2}
\end{equation*}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item 你也可以利用\cmdbs{operatorname}來將文字轉換成運算子
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{equation*}
\beta_i =
\frac{\operatorname{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}
     {\operatorname{Var}(R_m)}
\end{equation*}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}：使用\bftt{amsmath}的例子}
\begin{itemize}{\small
\item 將一連串的方程式按照等號排列
\begin{align*}
(x+1)^3 &= (x+1)(x+1)(x+1) \\
        &= (x+1)(x^2 + 2x + 1) \\
        &= x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1
\end{align*}
利用\bftt{align*}環境

% for whatever reason, this doesn't play well with the twoup environment
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,frame=single]{latex}
\begin{align*}
(x+1)^3 &= (x+1)(x+1)(x+1) \\
        &= (x+1)(x^2 + 2x + 1) \\
        &= x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1
\end{align*}
\end{minted}
\item 與號\keystrokebftt{\&}將左欄(等號之前)與右欄(等號之後)分離
\item 雙重反斜槓\keystrokebftt{\bs}\keystrokebftt{\bs} 開始新行
}\end{itemize}
